Practice in creating algorithms and determining the time complexity

Given the following tasks, complete the algorithm and identify the time complexity.


Even or Odd
Given a numeric value, determine if it is even or odd.
The function should take the value in as a parameter and return a boolean value (True if even, False if odd).
Leave a comment above the function stating the time complexity.

Less than 100
Given a list of numbers, determine if each item in the list is lower than 100.
The function should take in the list as a parameter and return a boolean value (False if there are any numbers greater than 100, True if all numbers are less than 100).

Repeated Names
Given a list of names, determine if any names are contained in the list more than once.
The function should take in the list as a parameter and return a boolean value (True if there are any repeated names, False if there are no repeats).

Sort List
Given a list of numbers, manually sort the list into ascending order (may not use built in .sort() method).
